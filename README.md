# 🛡️ Secure LAN Infrastructure for R&D Department

This project simulates a secure, isolated IT infrastructure for a Research & Development (R&D) team. It is designed as a **realistic sysadmin lab**, with strict access control, internal network services, and basic automation.

The infrastructure includes:
- Two servers (infra-server and VPN gateway)
- Client machines (developers)
- VPN access, SSH hardening, and UFW firewall
- NFS for shared user directories
- Basic automation and monitoring tools

> ⚠️ This project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes only.
